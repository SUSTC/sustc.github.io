<p>Established by the Municipality of Shenzhen, the South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC) is a publicly funded university in the Guangdong Province. In need of an excellent university that can enhance the city’s national and global competitiveness, Shenzhen is fully committed to the development of SUSTC as a top-tier university that excels in research and the cultivation of innovative talent. To this end, Professor Zhu Qingshi, former president of the University of Science and Technology of China and an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),was appointed as SUSTC’s founding president.</p>

<p>In March 2011, SUSTC welcomed its first cohort of undergraduate students. In April 2012, the Ministry of Education approved the establishment of SUSTC and designated the university to lead a comprehensive reform on higher education that would modernize the national university system and serve as a model for cultivating innovative talent.</p>

<p>The academic programs at SUSTC focus on sciences and engineering, complemented by selected programs in management science, humanities, and social science. Currently, SUSTC has eight departments: physics, chemistry, biology, electrical and electronic engineering, materials science and engineering, financial mathematics and engineering，mathematics (in preparation),and computer science (in preparation).</p>

<p>From the outset, SUSTC has built a top-rate international faculty body. Currently, over 90 percent of the teaching and research staff at SUSTC are overseas returnees and more than 50 percent have educational or work experience at the world’s top 100 universities.</p>

<p>SUSTC has pioneered a multi-variable admission system that evaluates each applicant on a holistic basis, using metrics including high school accomplishments, Gaokao results, and a specialized admissions test. SUSTC emphasizes small-classroom teaching, all-English instruction, and practical research experience. Student life is enriched through a residential college system and frequent guest lectures from top experts in the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>SUSTC’s governance system is comprised of a University Council, a Management Board led by the President, and an Academic Committee. The university has also set up a Faculty Senate and an external Presidential Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>The 1,943,800 m2campus is spread out in a picturesque area with nine hills and a stream flowing through it.  The campus has convenient access to public transportation and its architecture emphasizes a practical and modern eco-friendly design.</p>

<p>The university’s goal is to nurture students who are global, innovative, cutting-edge, and entrepreneurial.</p>
